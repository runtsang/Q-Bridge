    Classical CNN + RBF kernel hybrid model.
    Features are extracted via a shallow CNN, flattened, and compared
    against a set of trainable prototype vectors using an RBF kernel.
    The kernel similarities are then linearly mapped to the final
    four-dimensional output.  This architecture mirrors the quantum
    variant but remains fully classical, enabling fast inference
    on CPUs/GPUs.
