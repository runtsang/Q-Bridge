"""Combined classical QCNN with sampler-inspired architecture.

This module defines the QCNNGen129 model that merges the convolutional
stack from QCNN.py with a lightweight sampler network inspired by SamplerQNN.py.
The architecture is fully classical but retains the same interface as the
original QCNN factory, allowing seamless replacement in downstream pipelines.
