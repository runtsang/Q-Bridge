"""Quantum circuit builder for the HybridNATGraphQNN model.

The circuit is defined with PennyLane and can be differentiated with
PyTorch.  It uses a fixed adjacency graph to entangle the qubits.
The rotation parameters are shared across all samples and are
optimised jointly with the classical network.

The function returns a callable that accepts a feature vector
(`inputs`), a weight vector (`weights`), and the adjacency matrix
(`adjacency`) and produces a tensor of expectation values.
