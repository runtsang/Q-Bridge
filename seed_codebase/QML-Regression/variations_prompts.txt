1. i am using this ZZfeaturemap in my code from this link https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/stable/2.2/qiskit/circuit/library/data_preparation/_zz_feature_map.py, can you prepare a standalone file that contains all the content to use the class ZZFeatureMap
2. this file worked without any issue. now do the same with the RealAmplitudes as well, from this link https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/stable/2.2/qiskit/circuit/library/n_local/real_amplitudes.py#L139-L312
3. create two more variations for ZZFeatureMap classes so that i want to test its variation
4. create two more variations for RealAmplitudes classes so that i want to test its variation
